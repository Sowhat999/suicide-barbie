o	random blah

	 whilst typing this text, i got a word from Louie. as it turns out
	we will have to change the tune. great stuff! it means that binary
	release will be delayed for a 'couple' days.
	 stay tuned then :)

         ...
	
	 so, a 'couple' days had passed indeed. but not in vain - as we
	are now ready for the first official release of the binaries. thus
	you will be free to abandon those filthy leaked binaries you have 
	enjoyed so much.
	 instead we offer you _real_ credits, packed music, more visuals,
	steady framerate and of course support for various firmwares.


	 oh, and you think demoscene is about being original?
	you should watch this then...

o	how to run production

	 copy the contents of the archive to the ms0:/PSP/GAME/ folder.
	run production from xmb. if you're using 3xx OE firmware copy
	files to ms0:/PSP/GAME150/ instead.

	 this production has been tested and confirmed working under
	firmware 1.00, 1.50 and 3.40 OE-A.


o	tech stuff

	 no official sdk's or devkits were harmed during the production
	of this demo. not a single bad word was muttered addressing sony.
	homebrew sdk and retail psp, nicely hooked to our laptops with
	usb cables, were our true friends.

	 and if you ask, why memorystick led flashes all the time?
	yeah, we do stream our content; both data and music. so, make
	sure you have a fast enough stick; on-demand loading over
	usbhostfs is not really recommended..


 great success,
ReJ/TBL?Nesnausk! & eriQue/soniK cliQue
