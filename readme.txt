o	random blah

	 whilst typing this text, i got a word from Louie. as it turns out
	we will we have to change the tune. great stuff! it means binary
	release will be delayed for one more day.
	 stay tuned then :)


o	tech stuff

	 no official sdk's or devkits were harmed during the production
	of this demo. not a single bad word was muttered addressing sony.
	homebrew sdk and retail psp, nicely hooked to our laptops with
	usb cables, were our true friends.

	 and if you ask, why memorystick led flashes all the time?
	yeah, we do stream our content all the time.



great success,
ReJ/TBL?/Nesnausk!
